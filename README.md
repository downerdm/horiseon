# Horiseon Website Code Refactor

## The Task

A marketing agency wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their site will be optimized for search engines.  I included a list of the original "Acceptance Criteria" below.

I refactored a pre-existing website using semantic HTML. All DIVs were eliminated and replaced with either a proper, semantic HTML tag or SECTION.
All necessary modifications were also applied to the CSS stylesheet.

I made sure that accessibility was taken into consideration by putting all images into the main HTML file as well as adding ALT tags to all images.  I assigned a more appropriate page title to be shown on the browser tab.

I applied the "Scout Rule" and eliminated unnecessary and/or redundant code so that the CSS stylesheet is now easier to understand and is more eloquently structured.  Elements were moved to match their actual positioning on the page as much as was possible.  Unused code was removed.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
